# Soil Volume as a Bucket: Part 2


<!-- # Chalalnges of loss function -->
<!-- However, this is much of a bucket model that simplifies very hetegronegous conditions (see the blog post). In my experience, this model works pretty ok for point-based data. You can actually see the point of inflection from drainage stage to ET stage in observed drydown curves (this animation, again for the Part 2) and make sense of the parameters, as shown in previous studies. I hypothesize that this bucket type model may work for a small soil volume and provides an emergent pattersn of soil dynamics: emergent patterns that is aggregated from the core-scale equation, like Richards equation. However, there is also an influence of deepeer soil layer, that derives the pressure gradient, that actually the drives soil moisture dynamics. I am reading right now this book, also analysing the data, and making animations to make sense of all the dynamics. However, as shown in the curve on the right panel, the transition between different ET phases in the loss function is very difficult to distinguish in the drydown space. In fact, most studies determining critical soil moisture content do not derive this from the drydown space. Instead, they typically use either explore this parameter in the loss function space (which can be vulnerable to data uncertainty, as discussed in the next section) or combine soil moisture observations with ET observation from flux towers (xxxx). -->
